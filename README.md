# chess

## **Overview**
This project features a chess game that enables two players to compete against each other. It is developed with a strong emphasis on Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, enhancing its design and functionality. Key aspects include:

- **Two-Player Interaction**: The game is designed for a pair of players, each controlling a set of chess pieces, and playing in turns.

- **OOP Principles**: The game's architecture showcases OOP concepts:
  - **Polymorphism**: Different chess pieces demonstrate unique move sets while sharing common interfaces.
  - **Inheritance**: A base 'piece' class is extended to various specific chess pieces.
  - **Abstract Classes and Interfaces**: These are used to define standard behaviors for chess pieces and the game mechanics.

- **User Interface**: A straightforward interface for players to interact with the game, making moves and viewing the board.

### **Technolgy Required**
This project requires the Java programming language and JavaFX. Additionally, an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) capable of compiling and running Java code is needed.

#### **JavaFX Installation insructions for Windows and Mac**
